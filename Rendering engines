Most popular Rendering engines for javascript:
1. V8 : from Google is the most used JavaScript engine. Google Chrome and the many other Chromium-based browsers use it, as do applications built with CEF, Electron, or any other framework that embeds Chromium. Other uses include the Node.js and Deno runtime systems.
2. SpiderMonkey : is developed by Mozilla for use in Firefox and its forks. The GNOME Shell uses it for extension support.
3. JavaScriptCore:  is Apple's engine for its Safari browser. Other WebKit-based browsers also use it. KJS from KDE was the starting point for its development.[7]
4. Chakra : is the engine of the Internet Explorer browser. It was also forked by Microsoft for the original Edge browser, but Edge was later rebuilt as a Chromium-based browser and thus now uses V8.
