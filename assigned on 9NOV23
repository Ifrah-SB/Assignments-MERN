Q1: What is URL?
URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a reference or address used to access resources on the internet. In simpler terms, a URL is what you type into the address bar of your web browser to go to a specific website or resource.
A typical URL consists of several components:
 Scheme: This indicates the protocol used to access the resource."http," "https," "ftp," etc. 
 "http" and "https" are the most common, with "https" being a secure, encrypted version of 
 "http."
 Domain: This is the human-readable address of the server where the resource is hosted. For 
 example, In the URL "https://www.example.com," "www.example.com" is the domain.
 Path: This specifies the location or route to a specific resource on the server. In 
 "https://www.example.com/page1," "/page1" is the path.
 Query Parameters: These are additional parameters or information appended to the end of a URL 
 after a question mark.

Q2: Difference between http and https?
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) are both protocols used for transferring data over a computer network, but they have a key difference in terms of security:
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
  Unsecured.
  Data is not encrypted.
  Vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle Attacks
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):
  Secured with SSL/TLS: HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL (Secure Sockets 
 Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security)
  Data Encryption.
  Authentication.

Q3: What are Metatags?
Meta tags are HTML tags that provide information about a web page to browsers and search engines. These tags are placed within the <head> section of an HTML document and are not displayed on the actual web page. Instead, they convey metadata, which includes information about the page's content, character set, keywords, and more.

Q4: What is W3C?
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community that develops web standards to ensure the long-term growth and accessibility of the World Wide Web.It sets guidelines for technologies like HTML, CSS, and XML, promoting interoperability and a consistent web experience. W3C's work encompasses the creation of specifications, guidelines, and tools to enhance the functionality and universality of the web.

Q5: Different doctypes in html:

HTML doctype declarations indicate the version of HTML being used and help browsers render web pages correctly. Here are three commonly used doctype declarations:

HTML5: <!DOCTYPE html> is Used for modern HTML5 documents, providing the most up-to-date features and compatibility.
HTML 4.01 Strict: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC> Specifies HTML 4.01 in strict mode, which enforces a cleaner, more disciplined coding style.
HTML 4.01 Transitional: <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC> Allows the use of older, presentational HTML features for a smoother transition from legacy code to modern standards.

Q6: What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents, which represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects. In simpler terms, when you open a web page in your browser, the browser creates a model of that page in memory, and this model is referred to as the Document Object Model. Some key points are:
  Tree Structure: The DOM represents the HTML or XML document as a tree structure. Each 
  element, attribute, and piece of text in the document is represented as a node in the tree.

  Objects: Each node in the tree is an object, and these objects can be manipulated using 
  programming languages like JavaScript. This allows developers to interact with and 
  manipulate the content, structure, and style of a web page dynamically.

  Accessibility: The DOM provides a way for scripts (like JavaScript) to access and update the 
  content, structure, and style of a document. This enables developers to create interactive 
  and dynamic web pages.

  Event-Driven: The DOM is event-driven, meaning that it can detect and respond to events such 
  as user actions (e.g., clicks, keyboard input). Developers can write scripts to respond to 
  these events, creating dynamic and interactive web pages.

  Browser Independence: The DOM provides a standardized way for scripts to interact with web 
  documents, making it easier for developers to write cross-browser compatible code. This 
  means that code written to manipulate the DOM will work consistently across different web 
  browsers.
