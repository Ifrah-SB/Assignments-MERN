Differences between framework and API: Function:  Framework provides a structure and tools for building applications.  API defines rules for communication between software components.
                                       Abstraction: Framework offers a higher-level structure for application development. API operates at a lower level, facilitating component interaction.
                                       Control: Framework dictates overall application flow and structure. API allows more flexibility in application design and control flow
                                       Flexibility: Frameworks are less flexible, with set conventions and structures.
                                                   APIs offer flexibility, letting developers integrate functionality as needed.
                                       Scope: Frameworks encompass a broad range of tools for application development. APIs focus on specific functionalities or interactions.
                                       Examples: Framework examples include Django, Ruby on Rails, and Angular. API examples include Twitter API, Google Maps API, and Java API.

ASCII character set VS UTF8 VS UTF16 : 
  Use Cases:  ASCII is suitable for basic English text. UTF-8 and UTF-16 are more versatile, accommodating a wider range of characters and languages.
  Size: ASCII uses 7 bits. UTF-8 varies from 8 to 32 bits. UTF-16 uses a fixed 16 bits.
  Compatibility: UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII. UTF-16 is not backward compatible due to fixed 16-bit representation.
  Encoding: ASCII is single-byte. UTF-8 is variable-length. UTF-16 is fixed-length.
