1. What is Wireframing?
 Wireframing is a crucial part of the product design process. It is a visual representation of the workflow of a website or mobile application. Wireframes are used to establish the structure, layout, and functionality of a page or application. They help in planning the user experience without distractions from color, graphics, or content. Wireframing is a practice most commonly used by UX designers. This process allows all stakeholders to agree on where the information will be placed before the developers build the interface out with code . They also help to identify potential issues and make changes before the development process begins.
Wireframes can be created using paper or software-rendered tools . There are many tools available for creating wireframes, such as Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, Balsamiq, InVision, and many more .
Wireframes can be of different types, such as low-fidelity wireframes, high-fidelity wireframes, and interactive wireframes . Low-fidelity wireframes are simple and quick to create, while high-fidelity wireframes are more detailed and take longer to create . Interactive wireframes are more advanced and allow users to interact with the wireframe as if it were a real application.

 A programming language is a formal language that is used to create computer programs. It includes a set of instructions that are compiled into machine code and executed by the computer.Programming languages are used to create complex software applications, operating systems, and other computer programs . They are generally faster and more efficient than scripting languages because they are compiled into machine code. Programming languages can be divided into three types: low-level programming languages, middle-level programming languages, and high-level programming languages.

On the other hand, a scripting language is a type of programming language that is interpreted rather than compiled. Scripting languages are used to automate tasks and to create dynamic web applications . They are generally easier to learn than programming languages and require less code to perform the same task. Scripting languages are often used to write scripts that control other programs.
